# Supabase Configuration
# Get these values from your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard

# Public Supabase URL (safe to expose to client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

# Public anonymous key (safe to expose to client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Service role key for server-side operations (NEVER expose to client!)
# This key bypasses Row Level Security and should only be used in:
# - Server components
# - API routes
# - Server actions
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# Webhook secret for automatic revalidation (NEVER expose to client!)
# This is NOT a Supabase key - it's a custom secret YOU generate
# Generate a secure random string using: node scripts/generate-webhook-secret.js
# This is used to authenticate webhook calls to your /api/revalidate-products endpoint
SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secure-webhook-secret-here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project
# 3. Once your project is ready, go to Settings > API
# 4. Copy your Project URL and replace NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# 5. Copy your anon/public key and replace NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# 6. Copy your service_role key and replace SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# 7. Generate a secure random string for SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# 8. Save .env.local and restart your development server

# Security Notes:
# - .env.local should NEVER be committed to version control
# - Make sure .env.local is in your .gitignore file
# - Only NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to the browser
# - Service role key and webhook secret are server-only
